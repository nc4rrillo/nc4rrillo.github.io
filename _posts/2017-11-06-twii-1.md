### Open Source
Indigo is now open source! You can [browse the repository](https://github.com/nc4rrillo/indigo) and run the examples. 

### New properties
The following new properties were added this past week:
#### Border Radius
This allows you to specify how much the corners of a primitive are rounded.

#### Font Style
You can choose from italic or oblique styles for your fonts

#### Font Weight
For now only Bold is supported. This will be expanded in the future.

#### Text Decoration
For now only strike through is supported. This will be expanded in the future.

### New components
The following new components were added this past week:

- TextBox
  * The text box is pretty rough and supports a very crude form of text selection. It is a work in progress.

- CheckBox
